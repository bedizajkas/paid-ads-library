# ⚡ Quick Start Guide (Updated!)

## 🎯 New Super Simple Workflow - No Code Editing Required!

### For YOU (One Time Setup):

1. **Open `image-viewer.html` in any browser** (just double-click it!)

2. **Paste your 40 image URLs** into the text box (one per line)

3. **Click "💾 Save URLs"** button

4. **Done!** Images are now saved in your browser and will load automatically every time

5. **Share the HTML file** with your team via:
   - Email attachment
   - Slack/Teams upload  
   - Dropbox/Google Drive
   - Or host at https://app.netlify.com/drop

---

### For YOUR TEAM:

1. Open the HTML file in their browser
2. Click "💾 Save URLs" (if they want images to persist)
3. All images display automatically!

**No editing, no technical skills needed!** 🎉

## 🎮 Button Guide

- **📥 Load Images** - Display images from the text box (doesn't save)
- **💾 Save URLs** - Save images to browser + display them (they'll load automatically next time!)
- **🗑️ Clear Display** - Remove images from view (keeps URLs)
- **🗑️ Delete Saved** - Remove saved URLs from browser

---

## 💡 How It Works

When you click "💾 Save URLs", the images are stored in your **browser's localStorage**. This means:

✅ Images load automatically when you open the file  
✅ No internet connection needed after first load  
✅ Works in any modern browser  
✅ No code editing required  
✅ Perfect for sharing!

**Note:** Each person needs to click "Save URLs" on their own browser. The HTML file itself stays lightweight!

## 🌐 Want Everyone to See the Same Images Automatically?

If you want to share the file so images load automatically for EVERYONE without them clicking save:

### Option 1: Embed in HTML (5 minutes)
See the old `QUICK-START.md` for instructions on editing the `PERMANENT_URLS` array

### Option 2: Host Online (1 minute - EASIEST)
1. Save URLs in your browser first
2. Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
3. Drag `image-viewer.html`
4. Get URL: `https://your-site.netlify.app`
5. Share URL with team!

Everyone who visits the URL needs to click "Save URLs" once to persist images on their device.

---

## 🔄 Update Images Later

Just paste new URLs and click "💾 Save URLs" again. It overwrites the old ones!

## ❓ FAQ
